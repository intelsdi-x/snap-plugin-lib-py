==================

This is a library for writing plugins in Python for the Snap telemetry framework.

Brief overview of Snap architecture
-----------------------------------
For an overview of Snap checkout: `http://snap-telemetry.io/ <http://snap-telemetry.io/>`_.

Snap is an open and modular telemetry framework designed to simplify the collection, processing and publishing of data through a single HTTP based API. Plugins provide the functionality of collection, processing and publishing and can be loaded/unloaded, upgraded and swapped without requiring a restart of the Snap daemon.
