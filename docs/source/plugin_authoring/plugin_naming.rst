Plugin Naming
=============

The first naming decision you will need to make will be for your 
project/repository.  For this we suggest the following format.

::

    snap-plugin-<TYPE>-<PLUGIN_NAME>

**TYPE** is either *collector*, *processor* or *publisher* and the 
**PLUGIN_NAME** is the same name that your plugin will provide Snap when it does 
its initial handshake (more on the later).
